## About

[GR-Athena++](https://github.com/computationalrelativity/gr-athena) is a scalable code for 3+1 numerical relativity refactored from the [Athena++](https://www.athena-astro.app/index.html) magnetohydrodynamics code and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. The new main features of the code are

 * Support for [vertex-centered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08289) and [cell-centered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09139) spacetime variables
 * Dynamical spacetime solver based on the [Z4c](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2920) formulation of 3+1 general relativity and high-order operators
 * Adaptive mesh refinement algorithms for black hole evolutions in the puncture framework
 * GRMHD solver on dynamical spacetimes based on the conservative 3+1 Eulerian "Valencia" formulation and Athena++ constrained transport algorithm
 * Radiation transport solver on dynamical spacetimes based on the [M1 formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14858)
 * Support for various equations of state, including tabular microphysical models
 * [Deleptonization scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504072) for stellar core collapse
 * Gravitational-wave extraction algorithms based on Newmann-Penrose-Weyl and Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli approaches, output for Cauchy Characteristic evolution
 * Apparent horizon finder based on [fast flow algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9707050)
 * Support for various initial data solvers and readers, including [Lorene](https://github.com/computationalrelativity/lorene), [SGRID](https://github.com/sgridsource) and [RNS](https://github.com/computationalrelativity/RNSC), [TwoPunctures](https://github.com/computationalrelativity/TwoPuncturesC)
 
GR-Athena++ is developed by the [Computational Relativity (CoRe)](http://www.computational-relativity.org) collaboration at Jena (Germany) and Penn State (USA).
